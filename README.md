# Little Accountant Bot

A Skype bot that helps you collect and manage your daily spendings, bills etc. It's a sideproject to
keep track of what I am spending and for what.

# Abilities
* Nothing really. Please wait for an alpha :)


# Requirements (local)
* Node.js server
* Registered bot: http://www.botframework.com


# Requirements (server)
* I used the Azure Bot Service for easy setup (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/bot-service/),
but you should be able to host it anywhere just as you would run it locally.


# How to run locally
* Clone this repo
* Run "npm install" (most importantly botframework and restify)
* Run "node ./index.js" in the messages folder
* Note the process.env.NODE_ENV if you want to run it locally
* Get and run the emulator: http://docs.botframework.com/connector/tools/bot-framework-emulator


## Privacy statements
The bot will store the financial data you provide in a database hosted in the Microsoft
Azure Cloud infrastructure. That information is bound to a hashed version of your Skype ID.
In other words: Your Skype ID is not stored directly, but replaced by a randomized ID.
Granted, it's not really anonymous, but at least we don't store your Skype ID in the database.

Also, the bot uses the Microsoft Bot Framework and LUIS, which in turn collect and analyse
your message and message content (including your ID). Please see the Microsoft Privacy
Statement for more information regarding their data security and privacy.

We don't do anything with your data. We don't sell it, we don't analyse it, we usually don't
look at it except for bugfixing / operations. Since this is an open source and publicily
available project we don't really suggest you should trust us, but host the thing yourself if
you're paranoid.
